<p class="message">
  Hey there! I'm starting this blog right as I dive into the world of Data Science for the first time! I hope to be able to translate what I learn into posts that will ultimately help future aspiring data scientists.
</p>

I'm going to keep some of the info below for the first few weeks of this blog so that I can refer to them in the future. This about me page will certainly be built out much more by the end!

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/poole/poole/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mdo).
