# My first week in a Data Science Bootcamp:
## Let's dig in

We just wrapped up our first week of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. This first week was already pretty intense. We have explored working in command line, vs code, Git and Github, Python (including packages such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy), Big O, and more all while pulling together our first project of the bootcamp.

## Street team placement for Women Tech Women Yes

This was our first project assignment at Metis. We were challenged to worked in groups to analyze NYC MTA's Turnstile data help advice Women Tech Women Yes on optimal placement for their street crews.

### Objective

We received a  project request from Women Tech Women Yes in the email below:

> As we mentioned, we are interested in harnessing the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of our street team work, which is a significant portion of our fundraising efforts.
>
>WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.
>
>To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.
>
>Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use MTA subway data, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to help us optimize the placement of our street teams, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.

### Approach

We set out to analyze the most recent four weeks of MTA data for information that will help the client better determine when and where they can place their street teams in order to reach the most people. This will greatly expand their ability to both spread the word about Women Tech Women Yes and receive sign-ups for your upcoming fundraising gala.

For the project we set out to determine: 
* The top 5 busiest metro stops in NYC
* The busiest days of the weeks
* The busiest times of day

### Data Cleaning & Data Wranging

Below is a clip of the MTA dataset:

As you can see the dataset is not all that useful in the provided format. We cleaned up the data by removing duplicates, cleaning up the columns headers, and re-organizing the by turnstile.

It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
